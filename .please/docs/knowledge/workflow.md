# Project Workflow — StatusBeam

> Defines the development workflow conventions for the project.
> Referenced by `/please:implement`.

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth**: All work is tracked in the track's `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate**: Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` before implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
5. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware**: Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle within `/please:implement`:

### Standard Task Lifecycle

1. **Select Task**: Choose the next available task from `plan.md`
2. **Mark In Progress**: Update task status from `[ ]` to `[~]`
3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase)**:
   - Create test file for the feature or bug fix
   - Write unit tests defining expected behavior
   - Run tests and confirm they fail as expected
4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase)**:
   - Write minimum code to make failing tests pass
   - Run test suite and confirm all tests pass
5. **Refactor (Optional)**:
   - Improve clarity, remove duplication, enhance performance
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass
6. **Verify Coverage**: Run coverage reports. Target: >80% for new code
7. **Document Deviations**: If implementation differs from tech stack, update `tech-stack.md` first
8. **Commit**: Stage and commit with conventional commit message (per task)
9. **Update Progress**: Mark the task as completed in `## Progress` with a timestamp

### Phase Completion Protocol

Executed when all tasks in a phase are complete:

1. **Verify Test Coverage**: Identify all files changed in the phase, ensure test coverage
2. **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute all tests, debug failures (max 2 fix attempts)
3. **Manual Verification Plan**: Generate step-by-step verification instructions for the user
4. **User Confirmation**: Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding
5. **Create Checkpoint**: Commit with message `chore(checkpoint): complete phase {name}`
6. **Update Plan**: Mark phase as complete in `plan.md`

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (`@pleaseai/eslint-config`)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (ESLint + SonarCloud)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Development Commands

### Setup

```bash
bun install
```

### Daily Development

```bash
bun run dev          # turbo run dev (all apps)
# Per workspace:
bun run --filter '@statusbeam/web' dev
bun run --filter '@statusbeam/worker' dev
```

### Testing

```bash
bun test             # run tests
bun run typecheck    # turbo run typecheck
```

### Before Committing

```bash
bun run lint         # eslint .
bun run typecheck
bun test
```

### Deploy (Cloudflare)

```bash
bun run deploy       # worker + web via wrangler
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

- Every module must have corresponding tests (`bun test`)
- Mock external dependencies (Cloudflare bindings: D1, KV, Queues)
- Test both success and failure cases; validate Zod schema edge cases in `@statusbeam/core`

### Integration Testing

- Test complete check → store → render flows
- Verify D1 time-series writes and KV snapshot reads
- Test notification fan-out (Slack / webhook) and cache purge-on-change

## Commit Guidelines

Follow Conventional Commits (release-please drives versioning + CHANGELOG).
See `Skill("standards:commit-convention")` for details. All commit messages in
**English** (public OSS repo).

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code change without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All code implemented to specification
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Code coverage meets project requirements (>80%)
4. Code passes all configured checks (ESLint, typecheck, SonarCloud)
5. Progress updated in `plan.md`
6. Changes committed with a proper Conventional Commit message
